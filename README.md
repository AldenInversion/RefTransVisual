# RefTransVisual
This repository contains bash commands that are used to produce input files for IGV.
These input files facilitate visual inspection of potential insertion sites and orientation of the insertion.
All code mention above can be found in the Code_for_insertion_site_discovery.txt file.

p.s. I don't know how github works.
